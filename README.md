# cookiecutter-python

A simple cookiecutter for my projects.

## Installation 

Don't (unless you want to build off this). Use it directly. 

## Usage

First, install cruft:

```bash
pip install cruft
```

and then create your own repo using this as a template:

```bash
cruft create https://github.com/sg-s/cookiecutter-python/
```

The script will create a new directory (and repository) for you
with a bunch of useful things pre-set-up. 

## Features

### Pre-configured with testing infrastructure 

### Pre-configured with git hooks

### Ready to build docs
